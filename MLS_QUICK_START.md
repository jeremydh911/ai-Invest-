## 💡 Pro Tips

### Searching Like a Pro
- **Price Range:** Leave blank to see all price points
- **Property Type:** Filter by single-family, condo, townhouse, etc.
- **Status:** Default is "active" - change to find pending/sold properties
- **Multiple Searches:** Results persist, so search again with different filters

### Offer Strategy
- **Earnest Money:** Typically 2-5% of offer price shows serious intent
- **Contingencies:** Common ones: inspection, appraisal, financing
- **Closing Date:** Give yourself realistic time for due diligence
- **Competition:** Check DOM (days on market) to gauge demand

### Best Practices
- ✅ Always verify details before submitting offers
- ✅ Keep earnest money within 5-20% of offer price
- ✅ Use clear notes to explain your offer terms
- ✅ Download agreements for record-keeping
- ✅ Request extensions early if you need more time
