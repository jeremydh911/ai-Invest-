## DLP Policy Enforcement

### How DLP Works

1. **Content Inspection**
   - User attempts to send email/share data
   - System scans for sensitive patterns
   - Matches against DLP policy

2. **Pattern Matching**
   - SSN: `\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b`
   - Account: `\b\d{8,17}\b`
   - Credit Card: `\b(?:\d[ -]*?){13,19}\b`

3. **Action**
   - **BLOCK**: Content not sent, user notified, logged
   - **WARN**: User warned, can proceed with acknowledgment
   - **ALLOW**: Content sent without restriction

4. **Logging**
   - All violations logged to audit trail
   - Admin alerted for severe violations
   - Reports generated for compliance

### DLP Examples

#### Example 1: SSN in Email (BLOCKED)
```
User writes: "Employee John Smith (123-45-6789) needs benefits review"

System action: EMAIL BLOCKED
Reason: Social Security Number detected in recipient data
Pattern matched: \b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b
Context: Email (external communication)
User notification: 
  "❌ Email blocked - SSN detected
   Sensitive data cannot be sent via email.
   Use secure portal or remove data."
```

#### Example 2: Property Price External (WARNED)
```
User writes: "Property at 123 Main St sold for $450,000 last month"

System action: EMAIL WARNED
Reason: Property pricing detected in external communication
Pattern matched: sold for \$[\d,]+
Context: Email (some external contexts allowed)
User notification:
  "⚠️ External pricing data detected
   This may violate MLS confidentiality rules.
   Continue? [Proceed] [Cancel]"
```

#### Example 3: Internal Financial Data (ALLOWED)
```
User writes: "Account 123456789 balance reconciled"

System action: ALLOWED
Reason: Internal system communication
Context: Internal database (protected environment)
Policy: Account numbers allowed in internal systems
```
