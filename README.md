# Aloha-Bot-Company

Multi-container “agent ops” scaffold for running an enterprise-style team of agents (CEO, CFO/Finance, HR, Legal, IT, etc.).

## What this is

- A lightweight policy/template layer for operating a multi-agent org.
- A canonical master instructions template (with department routing tags and a user-editable global backend command block).

## Templates

- `policy/master_instructions.template.md`

## Notes

- This repository is meant to hold process/templates; it is not coupled to any one backend implementation.
